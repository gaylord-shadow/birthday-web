        <h2>Birthday!</h2>
        <p> it is sadie beagleys sweet 16 but some fun facts about about birthdays. A sweet sixteen is a coming-of-age party celebrating one's 16th birthday, mainly celebrated in the United States and Canada. While they are not a legal adult, typically, when they turn 16 is when many people learn to drive, get jobs, and assume other adult responsibilities. Some believe the name came up in the late 1980s after the NCAA tournament expanded to 64 teams, according to the NCAA's website. However, the term "Sweet 16" was frequently used in state high school basketball tournaments.
