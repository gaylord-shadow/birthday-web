    <h3>Birthday crafts are great to make for birthdays if you cant afford a Gift. Its also more meaning full because you put your time and effort into the girt instead of going to the store and grabbing something that just looks cool.
        But not just that its fun making small things by yourself can be a hobby and making something to make your friend smile is the best way to brighten your own mood.
        <p class="Sam">so do the thing and make a craft</p>
